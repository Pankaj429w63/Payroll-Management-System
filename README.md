Payroll Management System
A simple Payroll Management System created with Python and MySQL, designed to manage employee records, attendance, and payroll calculations efficiently. The project uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and connects to a MySQL database via pymysql, with the database hosted on a local XAMPP server.

Project Overview
The Payroll Management System is a tool to simplify employee management tasks like payroll calculations, attendance tracking, and record management. It automates calculations and stores data in a structured MySQL database, providing a reliable and user-friendly system for HR teams or small businesses.

Features
Employee Management: Add, update, and delete employee records, including personal details and work-related information.
Payroll Processing: Automates payroll calculations based on attendance, deductions, and salary details.
Attendance Tracking: Tracks employee attendance for accurate payroll calculation.
Error Handling: Provides feedback on errors (e.g., database connection issues) to improve user experience.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
GUI Library: Tkinter
Database: MySQL (hosted on a local XAMPP server)
Database Connection Library: pymysql
Installation
Prerequisites
Python - Make sure Python is installed on your computer. Download Python
XAMPP - Install XAMPP to set up a local MySQL database. Download XAMPP
pymysql Library - Install pymysql to allow Python to communicate with MySQL:
bash
Copy code
pip install pymysql
Setup
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/payroll-management-system.git
cd payroll-management-system
Start XAMPP

Open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services.
Create the Database

Open phpMyAdmin in XAMPP, and create a new database named payroll_system.
Import the database structure if provided (or manually create the necessary tables for employees, attendance, payroll, etc.).
Configure Database Connection

Open employee.py and update the database connection credentials if needed:
python
Copy code
db = pymysql.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",           # MySQL username
    password="your_password", # MySQL password
    database="payroll_system"
)
Usage
Run the Application

To start the Payroll Management System, run employee.py:
bash
Copy code
python employee.py
Using the GUI

The GUI will allow you to:
Add new employees
Update or delete employee information
View and calculate payroll based on attendance and salary data
Database Actions

Every action you perform (e.g., adding a new employee) will be reflected in the MySQL database. Ensure the XAMPP MySQL server is running when using the system.
Database Structure
Employees Table:

Stores employee details like EmployeeID, Name, Age, Department, Position, and Contact Information.
Attendance Table:

Tracks each employeeâ€™s attendance, used to calculate payroll based on days worked.
Payroll Table:

Holds data on salaries, including base salary, deductions, and final pay based on attendance and any additional rules.
Note: You may need to adjust table names and column names in the Python code to match your MySQL database structure.

Future Improvements
Enhanced Security: Adding user authentication and access control for different roles (e.g., admin, HR staff).
Reporting and Analytics: Adding features to generate payroll reports and visualize attendance data.
Cloud Deployment: Enable remote access by deploying the system to a cloud-based MySQL server.
